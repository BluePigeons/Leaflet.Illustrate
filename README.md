Leaflet.Illustrate
==================

Rich annotation plugin (drawing, text, and more) for Leaflet extending Leaflet.draw.  Designed to help people tell the story behind the maps that they create.

Created for [MapKnitter](mapknitter.org), a free and open-source tool for stitching (or orthorectifying, in geographer-speak) grassroots aerial imagery into a composite "satellite" map.  This Leaflet plugin is designed to address the needs of the MapKnitter community, in particular, but is useful in any applications where rich map annotation is desired.

MapKnitter is open-source software created and run by the [Public Lab for Open Technology and Science](publiclab.org), and this project is part of [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014).
